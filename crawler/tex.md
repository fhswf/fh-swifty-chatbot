|**4 **|**Contents:**<br>The module comprises three main areas: the European Central Bank (ECB) and its<br>monetary policy, European integration and foreign trade. The starting point is a detailed<br>introduction to the German and European economy. The first focus is put on the ECB's role<br>in the institutional mix, the refinancing process of commercial banks, and the transmission<br>process of monetary policy. The recent trends in the financial systems innovation are also<br>dealt with, in particular the new phenomena like blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, their<br>role and impacts. Focus two covers the process of economic integration in general as well<br>as in the specific context of the European integration. Recent developments such as the<br>impact of economic disintegration with Russia and geopolitical changes are discussed. In<br>the third focus, foreign trade topics, i.e., exchange rate systems, the formation of exchange<br>rates in a small and open economy as well as the essential theories of pricing (UIP, PPP)<br>are thematized.|**Contents:**<br>The module comprises three main areas: the European Central Bank (ECB) and its<br>monetary policy, European integration and foreign trade.

The students should, taking into<br>account their individual practical experience, independently and successfully analyze,<br>critically evaluate, and finally solve their responsibilities as management executives within<br>an industrial goods company, especially in the IT sector. For this purpose, they should<br>understand in detail the idiosyncrasies of industrial goods markets, interpret an international<br>environment, and independently design solutions. This management task requires the<br>interdisciplinary integration of (especially) marketing, financing, and international<br>management as well as an analytical, problem-oriented thought structure. The aim of the<br>online seminar is to transfer the learnt contents into real company situations as well as to<br>practice an interdisciplinary, international approach of working. At the same time, soft skills,<br>such as group work in intercultural teams, as well as electronic forms of co-operation will be<br>practiced.|**Learning objectives:**<br>The known perspective of consumer goods markets has been (particularly with regard to the<br>internationality) expanded onto the industrial goods.

|**4 **|**Contents:**<br>The module includes a master's thesis and a colloquium. The thesis requires the scientific<br>processing of an independently identified, research or practice-relevant problem/question<br>from the areas of management or business informatics. The master's thesis requires a high<br>degree of independence on the part of the student with regard to the selection of the<br>research problem/research questions, the research methods and the literature, as well as a<br>critical reflection and classification of existing research. Students can choose to write their<br>thesis in the context of their professional activity. The colloquium consists of a presentation<br>of the work and the methodology used, and a subsequent discussion.|**Contents:**<br>The module includes a master's thesis and a colloquium.
