FastMCP 2.12.1: OAuth to Joy FastMCP 2.12.1 strengthens OAuth proxy implementation with improved client storage reliability, PKCE forwarding, configurable token endpoint authentication methods, and expanded scope handling based on extensive community testing. FastMCP 2.12: Auth to the Races FastMCP 2.12 represents one of our most significant releases to date. After extensive testing and iteration with the community, we\\'re shipping major improvements to authentication, configuration, and MCP feature adoption. 🔐 OAuth Proxy bridges the gap for providers that don\\'t support Dynamic Client Registration, enabling authentication with GitHub, Google, WorkOS, and Azure through minimal configuration. 📋 Declarative JSON Configuration introduces fastmcp.json as the single source of truth for server settings, making MCP servers as portable and shareable as container images. 🧠 Sampling API Fallback tackles adoption challenges by letting servers generate completions server-side when clients don\\'t support the feature, encouraging innovation while maintaining compatibility. FastMCP 2.11: Auth to a Good Start FastMCP 2.11 brings enterprise-ready authentication and dramatic performance improvements. 🔒 Comprehensive OAuth 2.1 Support with WorkOS AuthKit integration, Dynamic Client Registration, and support for separate resource and authorization servers. ⚡ Experimental OpenAPI Parser delivers dramatic performance gains through single-pass schema processing and optimized memory usage (enable with environment variable). 💾 Enhanced State Management provides persistent state across tool calls with a simple dictionary interface, improving context handling and type annotations. This release emphasizes speed and simplicity while setting the foundation for future enterprise features. FastMCP 2.10: Great Spec-tations FastMCP 2.10 achieves full compliance with the 6/18/2025 MCP specification update, introducing powerful new communication patterns. 💬 Elicitation Support enables dynamic server-client communication and \"human-in-the-loop\" workflows, allowing servers to request additional information during execution. 📊 Output Schemas provide structured outputs for tools, making results more predictable and easier to parse programmatically. 🛠️ Enhanced HTTP Routing with OpenAPI extensions support and configurable algorithms for more flexible API integration. This release includes a breaking change to client.call_tool() return signatures but significantly expands the interaction capabilities of MCP servers. FastMCP 2.9: MCP-Native Middleware FastMCP 2.9 is a major release that, among other things, introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol. 🤝 MCP Middleware brings a flexible middleware system for intercepting and controlling server operations - think authentication, logging, rate limiting, and custom business logic without touching core protocol code. ✨ Server-side type conversion for prompts solves a major developer pain point: while MCP requires string arguments, your functions can now work with native Python types like lists and dictionaries, with automatic conversion handling the complexity. These features transform FastMCP from a simple protocol implementation into a powerful framework for building sophisticated MCP applications. Combined with the new File utility for binary data and improvements to authentication and serialization, this release makes FastMCP significantly more flexible and developer-friendly while maintaining full protocol compliance. FastMCP 2.8: Transform and Roll Out FastMCP 2.8 is here, and it\\'s all about taking control of your tools. This release is packed with new features for curating the perfect LLM experience: 🛠️ Tool Transformation The headline feature lets you wrap any tool—from your own code, a third-party library, or an OpenAPI spec—to create an enhanced, LLM-friendly version. You can rename arguments, rewrite descriptions, and hide parameters without touching the original code. This feature was developed in close partnership with Bill Easton. As Bill brilliantly put it , \"Tool transformation flips Prompt Engineering on its head: stop writing tool-friendly LLM prompts and start providing LLM-friendly tools.\" 🏷️ Component Control Now that you\\'re transforming tools, you need a way to hide the old ones! In FastMCP 2.8 you can programmatically enable/disable any component, and for everyone who\\'s been asking what FastMCP\\'s tags are for—they finally have a purpose! You can now use tags to declaratively filter which components are exposed to your clients. 🚀 Pragmatic by Default Lastly, to ensure maximum compatibility with the ecosystem, we\\'ve made the pragmatic decision to default all OpenAPI routes to Tools, making your entire API immediately accessible to any tool-using agent. When the industry catches up and supports resources, we\\'ll restore the old default -- but no reason you should do extra work before OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google! FastMCP 2.7: Pare Programming FastMCP 2.7 has been released! Most notably, it introduces the highly requested (and Pythonic) \"naked\" decorator usage: In addition, decorators now return the objects they create, instead of the decorated function. This is an important usability enhancement. The bulk of the update is focused on improving the FastMCP internals, including a few breaking internal changes to private APIs. A number of functions that have clung on since 1.0 are now deprecated. FastMCP 2.6: Blast Auth FastMCP 2.6 is here! This release introduces first-class authentication for MCP servers and clients, including pragmatic Bearer token support and seamless OAuth 2.1 integration. This release aligns with how major AI platforms are adopting MCP today, making it easier than ever to securely connect your tools to real-world AI models. Dive into the update and secure your stack with minimal friction. Stop Vibe-Testing Your MCP Server Your tests are bad and you should feel bad. Stop vibe-testing your MCP server through LLM guesswork. FastMCP 2.0 introduces in-memory testing for fast, deterministic, and fully Pythonic validation of your MCP logic—no network, no subprocesses, no vibes. Reflecting on FastMCP at 10k stars 🌟 In just six weeks since its relaunch, FastMCP has surpassed 10,000 GitHub stars—becoming the fastest-growing OSS project in our orbit. What started as a personal itch has become the backbone of Python-based MCP servers, powering a rapidly expanding ecosystem. While the protocol itself evolves, FastMCP continues to lead with clarity, developer experience, and opinionated tooling. Here’s to what’s next. Now Streaming: FastMCP 2.3 FastMCP 2.3 introduces full support for Streamable HTTP, a modern alternative to SSE that simplifies MCP deployments over the web. It’s efficient, reliable, and now the default HTTP transport. Just run your server with transport=\"http\" and connect clients via a standard URL—FastMCP handles the rest. No special setup required. This release makes deploying MCP servers easier and more portable than ever. MCP Proxy Servers with FastMCP 2.0 Even AI needs a good travel adapter 🔌 FastMCP now supports proxying arbitrary MCP servers, letting you run a local FastMCP instance that transparently forwards requests to any remote or third-party server—regardless of transport. This enables transport bridging (e.g., stdio ⇄ SSE), simplified client configuration, and powerful gateway patterns. Proxies are fully composable with other FastMCP servers, letting you mount or import them just like local servers. Use FastMCP.from_client() to wrap any backend in a clean, Pythonic proxy. Introducing FastMCP 2.0 🚀 This major release reimagines FastMCP as a full ecosystem platform, with powerful new features for composition, integration, and client interaction. You can now compose local and remote servers, proxy arbitrary MCP servers (with transport translation), and generate MCP servers from OpenAPI or FastAPI apps. A new client infrastructure supports advanced workflows like LLM sampling. FastMCP 2.0 builds on the success of v1 with a cleaner, more flexible foundation—try it out today! FastMCP is joining the official MCP Python SDK! FastMCP 1.0 will become part of the official MCP Python SDK! Introducing FastMCP 🚀 Because life\\'s too short for boilerplate. This is where it all started. FastMCP’s launch post introduced a clean, Pythonic way to build MCP servers without the protocol overhead. Just write functions; FastMCP handles the rest.

This tutorial will show you how to create a FastMCP server and deploy it to a public URL, then how to call it from the Messages API. Currently, the MCP connector only accesses tools from MCP servers—it queries the list_tools endpoint and exposes those functions to Claude. Other MCP features like resources and prompts are not currently supported. You can read more about the MCP connector in the Anthropic documentation.\\n\\nConnect FastMCP servers to the Anthropic API\\n\\nCall the Server\\nTo use the Messages API with MCP servers, you'll need to install the Anthropic Python SDK (not included with FastMCP): You'll also need to authenticate with Anthropic.

Note that you'll need to replace https://your-server-url.com with the actual URL of your server. In addition, we use /mcp/ as the endpoint because we deployed a streamable-HTTP server with the default path; you may need to use a different endpoint if you customized your server's deployment.

But to unlock the full potential of MCP—centralized services, multi-client access, and network availability—you need remote HTTP deployment. This guide walks you through deploying your FastMCP server as a remote MCP service that's accessible via a URL. Once deployed, your MCP server will be available over the network, allowing multiple clients to connect simultaneously and enabling integration with cloud-based LLM applications. This guide focuses specifically on remote MCP deployment, not local STDIO servers.\\n\\nDeploy your FastMCP server over HTTP for remote access\\n\\nChoosing Your Approach\\nFastMCP provides two ways to deploy your server as an HTTP service. Understanding the trade-offs helps you choose the right approach for your needs. The direct HTTP server approach is simpler and perfect for getting started quickly. You modify your server's run() method to use HTTP transport, and FastMCP handles all the web server configuration. This approach works well for standalone deployments where you want your MCP server to be the only service running on a port. The ASGI application approach gives you more control and flexibility. Instead of running the server directly, you create an ASGI application that can be served by Uvicorn. This approach is better when you need advanced server features like multiple workers, custom middleware, or when you're integrating with existing web applications.\\n\\n\", annotations=None, meta=None)], structured_content=None, data=None, is_error=False)\n"
